# Learning about Version Control
## Author: Thê (Alexander) Quach
 
Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

I like that I can retrieve previous versions of my work if I make a mistake. These checkpoints help me ensure I have a working version and let me play around with things without being worried about having to start over if I mess up.

I find branches, merging and pull requests to be a bit challenging. Being concious about working on branches and solving merge conflicts is something I need to practice more. Using branches effectively is something I need to work on.
